## About

Python module to produced bootstrapped confidence intervals and effect sizes.

Python 3.6 is strongly recommended, although this has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5.

In addition, the following packages are also required: matplotlib (2.0.2), seaborn (0.8), numpy (1.13.1), scipy (0.19.1), and pandas (0.20.3). To obtain these package dependencies easily, it is highly recommended to download the Anaconda distribution of Python from [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
